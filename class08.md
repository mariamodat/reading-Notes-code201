# CSS Layout 
**Controlling the Position of Elements**
|type | role |
|-----|------|
| fixed position | t positions the element in relation to the browser window |
| relative position | shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed |
| Absolute position | positions the element in relation to its containing element.|

# Float 
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

* left - The element floats to the left of its container
* right - The element floats to the right of its container 
* none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
* inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

# Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

 **the higher the resolution, the smaller the text appears.**
  ## Page Sizes
  Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web 
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).


# Fixed and Liquid width Layout !
A "fixed-width" layout is one in which the layout of the page is contained within a wrapper that doesn't adjust its size when the width of the browser changes. 
To create a fixed width layout, the width of the main boxes on 
a page will usually be specified in pixels (and sometimes their 
height, too).

Liquid layouts define layout regions that both resize with text, and reflow as needed to accommodate on-screen display.
The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width 
of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the 
screen.

# Layout Grids
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) 
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are 
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them 
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
 
 * A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.
