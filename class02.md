# HTML Texts 
 * Headings and paragraphs : HTML has six "levels" of 
headings 1. < h1> is used for main headings
         2.   < h2> is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings. 
         3.  < h3> element is used, and so on...
 
    **paragraphs** : By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line  with some space between it and  any subsequent paragraphs

 * **Bold** : The < b> element also represents a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different.
 * *italic* :  By enclosing words in the tags < i> and </ i> we can make 
characters appear italic.
