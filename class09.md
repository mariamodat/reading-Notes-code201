# HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE 
* Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to. 
* Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response. 
* State the code you want to run when the event occurs. 
## WAYS TO BIND AN EVENT TO AN ELEMENT
* TRADITIONAL DOM EVENT HANDLERS
HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.

Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).
