*features in HTML* 
| feature | its use |
|---------|---------|
| ID attribute | Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the
page.  |
| class attribute | Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within
a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. |
| block elements | like unordered lists and ordered lists | 
| grouping texts and elements in a block | The < div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. |
| grouping texts and elements inline | using < span > The most common reason why people use < span> elements is so that they can control the
appearance of the content of these elements using CSS. |
| iFrames | An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame. |

1. Header and footer : The < header> and < footer>
elements can be used for:
●● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
●● A header or footer for an individual < article> or < section> within the page.

2. Navigation : The < nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
3. Articles : The < article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. 
 
4. Aside : 
* When the < aside> element is used inside an < article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. 
 * When the < aside> element is used outside of an < article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
 5. heading groups : The purpose of the < hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more < h1> through < h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 
 6.figures : It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

# Process and Design 
## Getting your message across using design 
 ![img2](https://www.e-accent.com/images/blog/html-prototyping.png)

**The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.**
 1. content : Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate.
 2. prioritizing : By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from)
those items. 
3. Organizing : Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks
makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand) .
